Put some `*.nds` files in here and run `cargo test --release -- --nocapture` to test `dsd init` and compare it to the corresponding config directory in [`../configs/`](../configs/).

Also put `arm7_bios.bin` (SHA1 `6ee830c7f552c5bf194c20a2c13d5bb44bdb5c03`), which you can [extract from your DS device](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/ds-index/ds-bios-firmware-dump).
